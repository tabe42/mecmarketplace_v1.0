- [MecMarketplace](https://mecmarketplace.com/) is a platform that connects students selling used items with buyers

### About MecMarketplace
- Helps students save money by getting books from their seniors rather than buying fresh copies each semester
- Sellers can login using their google accounts and list their item on the market along with the asking price, contact information that potential buyers can reach out to
- Since the transactions are always between two college students, the payment is carried out in person, thereby preventing potential misuse of the platform
